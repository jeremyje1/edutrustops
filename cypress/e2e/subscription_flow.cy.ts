// NOTE: This spec is designed to accompany a live stripe-cli listener forwarding
// events to /api/stripe/webhook. Because automated interaction with the hosted
// Stripe Checkout page is restricted (crossâ€‘origin + Stripe's protections), the
// test treats the payment step as a manual action. Run with `npm run dev` and
// stripe listen... then start `npm run cy:open` and execute this spec.
