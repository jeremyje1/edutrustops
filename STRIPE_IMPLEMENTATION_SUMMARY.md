# Stripe Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've reviewed the pricing structure for EduTrust Ops and created a complete Stripe integration setup with the following components:

## Pricing Structure

### Subscription Tiers

1. **Core Plan** - $4,999/month or $49,990/year
   - For institutions up to 5,000 students
   - Includes all 4 Trust Operations modules and basic features

2. **Pro Plan** - $9,999/month or $99,990/year (Most Popular)
   - For institutions up to 20,000 students
   - Includes multi-campus support, SSO, and advanced features

3. **Enterprise Plan** - $16,999/month or $169,990/year
   - For unlimited students

- FCC Pilot Application Support: $4,999
- FVT/GE NSLDS File QA: $2,499/review
- Emergency Response: $999/incident

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated Checkout API Route
- Modified `/src/app/api/checkout/route.ts` to support both monthly and annual billing
- The route now accepts a `billing` parameter to determine which price to use

### 2. Stripe Setup Script
- Created `/scripts/stripe-setup.ts` to automate product creation in Stripe
- The script creates all products and prices with proper metadata
- Outputs price IDs to be added to environment variables

### 3. Verification Script
- Created `/scripts/verify-stripe-setup.ts` to verify the integration
- Checks API connectivity, price configurations, and webhook setup

### 4. Documentation
- Created `/docs/STRIPE_PRICING_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive pricing documentation
- Includes setup instructions, testing guidelines, and troubleshooting tips
- Created `/scripts/README.md` explaining how to use the setup scripts

### 5. Environment Variables
- Updated `.env.example` to include all required Stripe price IDs
- Supports both monthly and annual price IDs for each tier

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Setup Script**
   ```bash
   export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="your_stripe_secret_key"
   npx tsx scripts/stripe-setup.ts
   ```

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   Add the generated price IDs to your `.env` file:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_CORE=price_xxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_CORE_MONTHLY=price_xxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO=price_xxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_PRO_MONTHLY=price_xxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE=price_xxx
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE_MONTHLY=price_xxx
   ```

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Add webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
   - Select relevant events (checkout.session.completed, etc.)
   - Add webhook secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

4. **Test the Integration**
   - Use test cards in Stripe's test mode
   - Verify checkout flow works for all tiers
   - Test both monthly and annual billing options

5. **Consider Additional Features**
   - Customer portal for subscription management
   - Usage-based billing for add-ons
   - Discount codes for volume customers
   - Automated invoicing and receipts

## Key Benefits

- **Flexible Billing**: Supports both monthly and annual subscriptions with automatic discount calculation
- **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add new tiers or modify pricing
- **Add-On Support**: Framework for one-time purchases and usage-based billing
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guidelines for setup and management
- **Automated Setup**: Scripts to quickly create products in Stripe

The implementation is designed to be maintainable and scalable as EduTrust Ops grows.
